Solver for Navier Stokes equations with a Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin formulation, 
based on Tayfun E. Tezduyar and Masayoshi Senga, "Stabilization and shock-capturing parameters
in SUPG formulation of compressible flows", plus an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation.
Currently, the code is being ported to a object oriented version (see /cfd2) for better organization
and reusability.
