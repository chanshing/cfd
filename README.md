Solver for Navier Stokes equations with a Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin formulation on a 2D unstructured mesh, 
based on Tayfun E. Tezduyar and Masayoshi Senga, "Stabilization and shock-capturing parameters
in SUPG formulation of compressible flows", plus an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation.

The code is currently being ported to an object oriented version (see /cfd2) for better organization
and reusability.
